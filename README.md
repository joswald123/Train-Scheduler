# Train-Scheduler

This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 
This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js.
 
This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many 
minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Anyone can add or update information about train schedules and users from many different machines can be 
able to view the same information in a real time.
